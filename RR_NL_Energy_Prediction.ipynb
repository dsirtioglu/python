DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS\\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitions:\\r\\nElectricity:\\r\\nFlow of electrons used to light lamps or to operate washing machines. Electrons are elementary particles in an atom with a negative charge that flow by a potential difference. In practice, such a voltage difference is generated by, for example, power plants, combined heat and power installations at companies, wind turbines, solar cells or batteries.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupply:\\r\\nThe amount of electricity available for consumption in the Netherlands. The supply of electricity primarily includes production plus imports minus exports. \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumption:\\r\\nThe amount of electricity delivered to the end users in the Netherlands plus electricity produced for own company processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOwn consumption for electricity production:\\r\\nThe amount of electricity that a producer or installation consumes during electricity production.\\r\\n\\r\\nGross production:\\r\\nThe gross production is the total amount of electricity generated in the Netherlands. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet production:\\r\\nThe gross production minus the own consumption of the companies and installations which produce the electricity.\\r\\n\\r\\nImports and exports:\\r\\nElectricity that enters or leaves the country through high voltage grids. The Netherlands has direct connections with Belgium, Germany, England and Norway. According to plan, a connection with Denmark will also become operational in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nDistribution losses:\\r\\nTotal distribution losses, including physical losses due to the transport of electricity and administrative losses due to fraud, measurement errors and administrative deficiencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nExplanation of symbols:\\r\\n\\r\\nempty cell : not applicable \\r\\n. : data not available or not reliable or confidential\\r\\n* : provisional figure\\r\\n** : revised provisional figure (but not definite)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this table an empty cell is also used for cells with value nill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3.
